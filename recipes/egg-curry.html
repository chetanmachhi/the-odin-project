        <h1>Description</h1>
        <p>Egg curry is a popular Indian dish where boiled eggs are cooked in a spiced, 
            flavorful gravy. The gravy is typically made from a base of onions, tomatoes, 
            and a variety of spices like turmeric, cumin, coriander, and garam masala. 
            The eggs are usually added to the curry towards the end of cooking, 
            allowing them to absorb the flavors of the sauce. 
            It’s often enjoyed with rice, naan, or roti.</p>
